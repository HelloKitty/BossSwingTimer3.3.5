# BossSwingTimer for 3.3.5 clients

This is a port of [BossSwingTimer](http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/bossswingtimer) which is an addon that helps predict incoming boss swings.

"Displays a movable/resizable bar with ticks indicating expected time of next enemy auto attacks. Current target is marked with red, focus with yellow; white ticks are faded out depending on expected damage.

Currently there is no support for dual wielding enemies, as the combat log API does not differentiate between main hand and off hand attacks, although it is somewhat possible to guess from damage."

##Commands

/bst enable - Enables the addon.

/bst disable - Disables the addon.

/bst config - Open the configuration dialog of the addon.
